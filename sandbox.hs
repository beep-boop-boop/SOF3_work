### Q3.3 Recursions as fixed points

We can always write a recursive definition as a fixed point of some
function.  A fixed point of a function `f::a -> a` is a value `z::a`
such that:
```haskell
z = f z
```

A function can have none, one or many fixed points.  If it has many
fixed points, then we always get the **least fixed point**, that is
the one with the worst behaviour: this is the nature of computation.
Bad behaviour is non-termination (which may be an explicit error
message if we are lucky, or infinite internal computation if not.)

We can use the function `fix` to compute fixed points.  It is defined
in the library `Data.Function` but, rather than import the library, we
repeat the definition here:
-}
fix :: (a->a) -> a
fix    f       = f (fix f)
{-
Note that this concentrates all of the recursion into one place, the
`fix` function.  A definition `x = fix f` creates a graph with:
1. a subgraph for the thunk representing the function named `f` 
2. a root node, representing `x`, with a pointer to the Node at 3:
3. a node representing an application, with a pointer to the thunk
   representing `f` at Subgraph 1, and a pointer to the Node at 2.

Lazy evaluation is implemented by each time that there is a demand for
part of `x`, the application is unwound one step at a time until
enough of `x` has been computed to satisfy the demand.  In eager
evaluation, Node 3 is completely unwound (which may result in an
infinite computation) before considering any attempt to evaluate `x`.

For example, we could have defined `ones`:
-}
ones' :: [Integer]
ones' = fix (1:)
{-
Define a new version of `nats`, `nats'`, using `fix`. 
-}
nats' :: [Int]
nats' = undefined
ackermann :: Integer -> Integer -> Integer
ackermann 0 n = n+1
ackermann m 0 = ackermann (m-1) 1
ackermann m n = ackermann (m-1) (ackermann m (n-1))
{-
The importance of this function is that it is not _primitive
recursive_ (see THE3), and one of the first to be identified.
**Warning!** do not evaluate this function for first value greater
than `3`: it takes a very long time to evaluate (`ackermann 4 2` has
19,729 decimal digits).

Express `ackermann` using `fix`.

### Q3.5

Given as input a list that has two **consecutive** occurrences of the

should be `1`.

numbers: they both obey [the Peano axioms](https://brilliant.org/wiki/peano-axioms/),
one of which is the axiom of induction.

### Q4.3 Summation of odd numbers

Given a positive `Nat` (that is, for any value not `Zero`) define a
function that directly encodes the summation of the odd numbers from
`1` up to `2*n - 1`, where the numbers are encoded as encoded as a
`Nat`:
```haskell
let Succ m = twoN /*/ n in -- encodes m == 2*n - 1 
  oneN /+/ threeN /+/ ... /+/ m
```

**Hint** rather than trying to encode subtraction, define the function
in two cases
1. One that deals with `n==1` (encoded as a `Nat`).
2. One that deals with larger values of `n==k+1`, for positive `k`,
   and rewrite the formula for the final value in terms of `k` (all
   encoded as values in `Nat`).

## Q3 `All` and `Any`

The Haskell base libraries include, in `Data.Monoid`, two renamings of
`Bool` instantiated as `Monoid`: `All` and `Any`.  These are used to
implement two functions in `Prelude` with types:
```haskell
all, any :: Foldable t => (a -> Bool) -> t a -> Bool
```

The expression `all p xs` returns `True` exactly when every element in
`xs` satisfies `p`, and `False` otherwise; `any p xs` returns `False`
when every element in `xs` satisfies `not . p`.  Implement your own
versions: `all'` and `any'` using `foldMap` and the monoids
[`All`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.14.1.0/docs/Data-Monoid.html#t:All)
and
[`Any`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.14.1.0/docs/Data-Monoid.html#t:Any).
You will need the accessors `getAny :: Any -> Bool` and `getAll :: All
-> Bool` as well as the constructors, `Any :: Bool -> Any` and `All ::
Bool -> All`.
-}
all', any' ::  Foldable t => (a -> Bool) -> t a -> Bool

any' pred xs = getAny (foldr (\x acc -> Any (pred x) <> acc) mempty xs)
{-
The functions `all'` and `any'` have the same structure.  You are
going to write a function, `compact` that abstracts this structure.
The function `compact` can be used to create versions of `all` and
`any`:
-}
all'', any'' :: Foldable t => (a -> Bool) -> t a -> Bool
all'' = compact All
any'' = compact Any
{-
The function relies on being able to extract a `Bool` from a monoid
over `Bool`.  To do this first define a class `Extractable` that has
one method, `extract :: a -> Bool`.  Then instantiate it for `Any` and `All`.
